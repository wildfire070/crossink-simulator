# CrossInk Simulator

A desktop simulator for [CrossInk](https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk). Compiles the firmware natively and renders the e-ink display in an SDL2 window. No device required.

> [!NOTE]
> **Platform support:** macOS and Linux/WSL use different native compiler and library flags. Start from `sample-platformio-macos.ini` on macOS, or `sample-platformio-linux-wsl.ini` on Linux/WSL. Native Windows is not supported; use WSL and follow the Linux instructions.

> [!WARNING]
> This has been tested on x86_64 macOS (Intel), ARM64 macOS (Apple Silicon,
> M4), and Ubuntu under WSL on Windows. Other platforms may need additional
> libraries or platform-specific stubs.

## Prerequisites

SDL2 and `curl` must be installed on the host machine. Linux/WSL users also need OpenSSL development headers for MD5 support.

```bash
# macOS
brew install sdl2

# Linux — Debian/Ubuntu (including WSL)
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libssl-dev

# Linux — Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install SDL2-devel openssl-devel

# Linux — Arch
sudo pacman -S sdl2 openssl
```

## Integration

Add the simulator to your firmware's platformio.ini as a `lib_dep` and configure the `[env:simulator]` environment. Use the sample file for your host OS:

- `sample-platformio-macos.ini`
- `sample-platformio-linux-wsl.ini`

No scripts need to be copied into the firmware repo for the simulator to build. The simulator library automatically patches consumer-side compatibility issues from its own build script when PlatformIO fetches it as a dependency, including the common `GfxRenderer::setOrientation()` hook needed for SDL window resizing.

Keep the sample `build_src_filter` exclusions unless your firmware has already
moved those files behind simulator guards. In the current CrossPoint layout,
the firmware-owned `CrossPointWebServer` and `WebDAVHandler` compile against
the simulator's lower-level `WebServer`, `WebSocketsServer`, and
`NetworkClient` shims. This exercises the real settings, files, status, and
WebDAV routes instead of a reduced simulator-only substitute.

The simulator defaults to the X4 panel shape. Device-specific environments can
extend the base simulator environment with one of these flags:

- `-DSIMULATOR_DEVICE_X3` switches the framebuffer to 792x528 landscape,
  selects the X3 board profile, and exposes the simulator tilt sensor.
- `-DSIMULATOR_DEVICE_X4_PRO` keeps the X4 family's 800x480 framebuffer and
  selects the X4 Pro board profile. It exposes touch and swipe input, the
  capacitive Home key, the RTC, display inversion, and frontlight state.
- `-DSIMULATOR_DEVICE_X4_CLASSIC` keeps the 800x480 framebuffer while selecting
  the buttons-only X4 Classic profile. It has no touch or frontlight, but keeps
  the Classic's RTC and USB Drive capabilities.

The sample PlatformIO files include ready-to-use `simulator_x3` and
`simulator_x4_pro` and `simulator_x4_classic` environments.

Device-specific simulator implementations belong in this repository. For example, a consuming firmware environment may select Sticky with `-DSIMULATOR_DEVICE_STICKY`, but Sticky mouse-to-touch handling, `BoardConfig` compatibility, and any required HAL or ESP-IDF shims must be implemented and published from `crossink-simulator`. Do not copy those shims into the firmware repository.

When developing both repositories side by side, a symlink dependency is useful for testing unpublished simulator changes. That local build is not sufficient release validation: publish the simulator revision, point or pin the firmware dependency to it, and rebuild through the Git dependency before considering the firmware environment usable from a fresh checkout.

If a fork has a custom renderer and the auto-patch cannot recognize it, its simulator build should notify the display when orientation changes:

```cpp
#ifdef SIMULATOR
display.setSimulatorOrientation(static_cast<int>(o));
#endif
```

Put that in the renderer's orientation setter after updating the renderer's own orientation state.
By default, the simulator keeps its own `JPEGDEC`, `PNGdec`, and QRCode compatibility shims so existing firmware projects can update this library without changing their simulator environment. To test against the native decoder libraries instead, follow the opt-in comments in the sample PlatformIO files: define `CROSSPOINT_SIM_USE_NATIVE_DECODERS`, set `lib_compat_mode = off`, change simulator `lib_ignore` to `hal, WebSockets`, and add the native `PNGdec`/`JPEGDEC` dependencies. `WebSockets` is ignored only in native simulator builds because this repo supplies the host-backed `WebSocketsServer` implementation.

If you only want a self-contained simulator dependency, stop there.

If you also want the `Run Simulator` task to appear in the consuming repo's PlatformIO IDE task list (under the "Custom" folder), let the consuming project own the IDE task registration. Add `custom_run_simulator_target_owner = project` to `[env:simulator]`, then add one project-level hook:

For a normal fetched dependency:

```ini
custom_run_simulator_target_owner = project

extra_scripts =
  pre:scripts/gen_i18n.py
  pre:scripts/git_branch.py
  pre:scripts/build_web.py
  post:.pio/libdeps/$PIOENV/simulator/run_simulator_project.py
```

For a local symlinked dependency:

```ini
custom_run_simulator_target_owner = project

extra_scripts =
  pre:scripts/gen_i18n.py
  pre:scripts/git_branch.py
  pre:scripts/build_web.py
  post:../crossink-simulator/run_simulator_project.py
```

Use the symlink form only when the `CrossInk` repo and this `crossink-simulator` repo are checked out side by side and your `lib_deps` entry is:

```ini
simulator=symlink://../crossink-simulator
```

The `custom_run_simulator_target_owner = project` line tells the library-side hook not to register the same launcher a second time. Without that, closing one simulator window can immediately relaunch another because both the library hook and the project hook try to own `run_simulator`.

Do not point `post:` at `run_simulator.py` directly. That file is already auto-loaded via `library.json` and is the backward-compatible library hook.

The `post:` line above only exposes the task in the consuming project UI. The actual launcher logic still lives in this simulator repo.

## Setup

Place EPUB books at `./fs_/books/` in the repo's root. This maps to the `/books/` path on the physical SD card.

## Build and run

Run this command from the project after you have added the `[env:simulator]` config to `platformio.ini`. Alternatively, if you added the project hook above, you can click "Build" from PlatformIO's IDE task list and then "Run Simulator" (nested under the "Custom" folder).

```bash
pio run -e simulator -t run_simulator
```

After the simulator has been built once, launch the existing binary without
checking or rebuilding its dependencies:

```bash
pio run -e simulator -t run_simulator_no_build
```

The project hook exposes this as **Run Simulator (No Build)** alongside the
existing **Run Simulator** task in PlatformIO's Custom folder.

## Controls

| Key    | Action                             |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| ↑ / ↓  | Page back / forward (side buttons) |
| ← / →  | Left / right front buttons         |
| Return | Confirm / Select                   |
| Escape | Back                               |
| P      | Power                              |
| S      | Simulate sleep                     |
| H      | X4 Pro capacitive Home key         |
| Mouse  | X4 Pro touch, tap, and swipe       |

When the simulator is on the sleep screen, pressing any mapped simulator key wakes it. Under the hood the simulator relaunches itself and reports a synthetic power-button wake, because the native build has no real ESP deep-sleep resume path.

## Automated QA and screenshots

Two optional environment variables make repeatable navigation and screenshot
tests possible without desktop-control permissions:

- `CROSSPOINT_SIM_INPUT_SCRIPT` schedules input as
  `<milliseconds>:<action>`, separated by semicolons. Button actions use
  `<key>[:<hold-milliseconds>]`; keys are `BACK`, `ENTER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`,
  `UP`, `DOWN`, `POWER`, `SLEEP`, `HOME`, and `QUIT`. A normal key press is
  held for 80 ms unless a duration is provided.
- X4 Pro touch actions use `TAP:<x>,<y>[,<hold-milliseconds>]` or
  `SWIPE:<x1>,<y1>,<x2>,<y2>[,<duration-milliseconds>]`. Coordinates are in
  displayed logical pixels, so they match UI layouts and screenshots after the
  firmware changes orientation. Normalized coordinates from 0.0 to 1.0 are
  also accepted for existing scripts.
- `CROSSPOINT_SIM_SCREENSHOTS` saves BMP screenshots as
  `<milliseconds>:<path>`, separated by semicolons. Create the destination
  directory before running the simulator.
- A sleep/wake test starts a fresh simulator process, matching the existing
  deep-sleep model. Set `CROSSPOINT_SIM_INPUT_SCRIPT_AFTER_WAKE` and
  `CROSSPOINT_SIM_SCREENSHOTS_AFTER_WAKE` for that second process. The
  pre-sleep schedules are cleared during relaunch so they cannot repeat
  forever.

Times are measured from process startup. For example:

```bash
mkdir -p ./qa-artifacts
CROSSPOINT_SIM_INPUT_SCRIPT='900:DOWN;1250:DOWN;1600:DOWN;1900:ENTER;3000:QUIT' \
CROSSPOINT_SIM_SCREENSHOTS='2400:./qa-artifacts/settings.bmp' \
  .pio/build/simulator/program
```

An X4 Pro touch and Home-key smoke test can use:

```bash
CROSSPOINT_SIM_INPUT_SCRIPT='2000:TAP:240,530;3000:HOME:100;3900:QUIT' \
CROSSPOINT_SIM_SCREENSHOTS='2500:./qa-artifacts/x4-pro-settings.bmp;3500:./qa-artifacts/x4-pro-home.bmp' \
  .pio/build/simulator_x4_pro/program
```

A deterministic sleep/wake smoke test can use:

```bash
CROSSPOINT_SIM_INPUT_SCRIPT='900:SLEEP;3500:ENTER' \
CROSSPOINT_SIM_INPUT_SCRIPT_AFTER_WAKE='2200:QUIT' \
CROSSPOINT_SIM_SCREENSHOTS_AFTER_WAKE='1600:./qa-artifacts/wake.bmp' \
  .pio/build/simulator/program
```

The screenshot contains the SDL renderer output at the host's actual drawable
resolution, including Retina/HiDPI scaling. BMP is used because it is supported
directly by SDL2 and adds no image-encoding dependency to the simulator.

## Notes

**Host-backed network flows**: OPDS/catalog downloads and KOReader sync use the
host's `curl` binary through simulator implementations of `HTTPClient` and
`esp_http_client`. This keeps the firmware code path intact while allowing the
desktop build to reach real HTTP/HTTPS services.

**Mocked downloads**: Set `CROSSINK_SIM_HTTP_MOCK_ROOT` to a folder of local
fixtures to make host-backed HTTP requests return local files by basename before
falling back to the real network. This is useful for SD-font testing because the
firmware can request its normal release URLs while the simulator serves a local
`fonts.json` and `.cpfont` files:

```bash
cd /path/to/firmware
python3 -m pip install -r lib/EpdFont/scripts/requirements.txt
python3 lib/EpdFont/scripts/build-sd-fonts.py \
  --only NotoSansExtended \
  --manifest \
  --base-url "https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-fonts/releases/download/local/"
CROSSINK_SIM_HTTP_MOCK_ROOT="$PWD/lib/EpdFont/scripts/output" \
  pio run -e simulator -t run
```

The mock still uses the firmware's normal manifest parsing, file download,
write-to-SD, `.cpfont` validation, registry refresh, and font-selection flow.

**File transfer**: The simulator provides host-backed `WebServer`,
`WebSocketsServer`, and `NetworkClient` shims so firmware-owned file-transfer
routes can run on the host. Firmware web servers that bind port 80 are exposed
on `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`; WebSocket servers that bind port 81 are exposed on
`ws://127.0.0.1:8081/`. Set `CROSSPOINT_SIM_HTTP_PORT` to another unprivileged
port if that pair is occupied; the WebSocket endpoint uses the following port.
For example, `CROSSPOINT_SIM_HTTP_PORT=18080` exposes HTTP on 18080 and
WebSocket on 18081. This supports the browser file manager, WebSocket upload
progress, streamed downloads, and common WebDAV-style requests such as
`OPTIONS`, `PROPFIND`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `MKCOL`, `MOVE`, and `COPY`. WebDAV
`LOCK` and `UNLOCK` remain compatibility-only unless the firmware implements
locking semantics.

The `run_simulator` target also accepts the port through PlatformIO, which is
convenient when the conflict is permanent on a development machine:

```ini
[env:simulator]
custom_simulator_http_port = 18080
```

Direct binary launches use the environment variable form.

**Firmware updates**: OTA and SD-card firmware flashing are non-destructive in
the simulator. The simulator stubs those update paths so the UI can be opened
without flashing firmware or changing boot partitions.

**Image previews**: The default simulator shims decode JPEG and PNG files on the
host and render a rough grayscale preview through the firmware's normal image
callbacks. This is meant to make image pages and PNG sleep overlays visible
while testing desktop flows. Native decoder libraries can be enabled with the
sample config's opt-in flags when decoder compatibility matters more than the
self-contained default. Neither mode simulates device-specific e-ink image
quality, refresh behaviour, or memory pressure.

**Cache**: On first open of an ebook, an "Indexing..." popup will appear while the section cache is built. If you see rendering issues after a code change that affects layout, delete `./fs_/.crosspoint/` to clear stale caches.

> [!WARNING]
> **Upstream compatibility:** The simulator mirrors interfaces used by Crosspoint. If Crosspoint adds or changes methods in a shared library and the simulator build reaches that code path, the simulator can fail to compile or link until a matching implementation or stub is added here. In many cases this is just a small no-op shim. Open a PR if the change is broadly applicable to CrossPoint-based forks.

## Checking task stack budgets

When a consuming firmware exports `CROSSINK_SIMULATOR_STACK_BUDGETS` (as
CrossInk's device-resource smoke runner does), every simulated task creation
logs its requested size and flags an entry that exceeds that profile's declared
budget. This logical check does not require a special build and remains useful
for catching a task whose configured ESP32 stack is clearly too large for its
device profile.

The normal simulator uses desktop threads. To inspect the host call depth inside
those configured task budgets during QA, add these flags to the **consuming
firmware environment's** `build_flags` (alongside its existing flags), then
rebuild that environment:

```ini
  -DCROSSPOINT_SIM_STACK_CHECK
  -finstrument-functions
  -fno-omit-frame-pointer
  -fno-optimize-sibling-calls
  -ldl
```

Apply the flags to the whole environment, including source-built libraries such
as FreeType, not just to the simulator library. This works with all device
profiles: the budget comes directly from each firmware `xTaskCreate`,
`xTaskCreatePinnedToCore`, or `xTaskCreateStatic` call. ESP-IDF expresses these
budgets in **bytes**, including on C3. Static-task buffers remain unused on the
host; only their requested byte budget is enforced.

An instrumented build defaults to fail mode. For example, from the firmware
project:

```sh
pio run -e x4-pro-simulator -j1
CROSSPOINT_SIM_STACK_CHECK=fail .pio/build/x4-pro-simulator/program
```

Every instrumented function entry samples host stack depth, including nested
calls and fixed-size local arrays. Exceeding a task's budget prints its name,
used/budget bytes, function/caller addresses, and an ASLR-independent image
offset for symbolication, then exits with code 86.
`run_simulator` and `run_simulator_no_build` propagate that failure to PlatformIO.
Use `CROSSPOINT_SIM_STACK_CHECK=warn` to continue after one warning per task, or
`off` to disable measurement in that run. Requesting checks in a normal build
fails at startup with rebuild instructions, rather than silently skipping them.

`uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark` reports the minimum **sampled host** headroom in
bytes; zero means exhausted or unavailable (uninstrumented/main thread). Reading
another task's watermark is synchronized. Desktop threads retain their normal
OS stack, allowing the checker to print a useful diagnostic without relying on
OS minimum stack sizes or crashing in the diagnostic itself.

Both checks are diagnostic approximations, not ESP32 emulation. Profile checks
compare a requested size with a declared device envelope. Host measurements vary
with ABI, pointers, compiler optimizations, and the instrumentation itself. They
can produce host-only failures or miss device-only failures. The monitor does
not measure the SDL/main thread, precompiled system-library peaks, or temporary
dynamic stack allocations between hooks. Instrumented builds are slower and
should not be used for performance measurements. Keep device compiler
stack-frame checks and real hardware stack-watermark testing as separate checks;
do not raise a device task's budget solely to silence a simulator warning.

Regression probes (no SDL needed):

```sh
python3 tests/run_stack_check.py
```
